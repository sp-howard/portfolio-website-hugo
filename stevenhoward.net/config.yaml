      **Hi! I'm Steven**, a lifelong technology enthusiast and an IT professional of 7 years (and counting!). I thrive on new challenges. Wrapping my head around a complex problem, researching solutions, generating a proof of concept, implementing, testing, and documenting... I find peace in trusting the process, knowing that any challenge can be solved with willpower and determination. Whether it's consulting a different resource, or simply taking a walk and returning to the problem at a later point... **No matter the problem, I will find the solution**. 

      My journey began as a Web Developer. I dove headlong into the deep waters of software development, and I **fell in love**. The sense of satisfaction I get when fixing a bug that had been eluding me for ages is unparalleled. 

      Due to life circumstances, I put my JavaScript dreams to rest temporarily, and transitioned into the world of IT Support. My first few years were spent in the Managed Service Provider space, where my growth was exponential. Every day I was presented with a problem I'd never encountered. A piece of software I'd never used. An error I'd never seen. ***And I made it work again.*** I found that IT scratched that same itch that Coding had introduced me to. I continued down that path, further honing my skills in Winders Server Administration and Cisco Networking. I became an essential resource to any team I was a part of. 

      Now, I'm ready to enter a new arena: Cloud Computing. I'm captivated at the possibilities this technology provides. I've spent many months drinking from the firehouse that is AWS / DevOps / Infrastructure as Code. I invite you to explore my projects, especially the **Cloud Resume Challenge**. I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished, and I hope to transfer these skills to help your business and place it firmly on the cutting-edge.
